This guidance method is used primarily for missiles that require constant control during their flight, ensuring precise targeting. Wire-guided missiles are most commonly employed for short-range, high-precision applications like anti-tank missiles, offering real-time control throughout their flight."

      "text": "The basic operation of wire-guided systems includes several stages:\n1. Launch: The missile is launched from its platform, such as a ground-based launcher, vehicle, or aircraft.\n2. Signal Transmission: A wire unspools as the missile flies, maintaining a direct link between the missile and the operator. This wire transmits control commands.\n3. Target Adjustment: The operator uses controls to send signals through the wire to adjust the missile's course as needed.\n4. Impact: Upon reaching the target, the missile either detonates on impact or uses a proximity fuse. The wire is detached after impact or before the missile reaches the target."

The propellant is typically a combination of fuel and oxidizer that is mixed together into a homogeneous solid grain.

Upon ignition, the propellant burns from the inner core outwards, producing a continuous stream of high-pressure gases. These gases exit through a converging-diverging nozzle, converting thermal energy into kinetic energy to generate thrust. Burn duration and thrust characteristics are tailored by grain geometry and propellant chemistry."

It was guided by an infrared homing system and designed to destroy surface targets, such as enemy radar installations and tanks. Over the decades, ASMs evolved into highly precise, long-range weapons capable of striking hard and soft targets. They saw widespread use during the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and more recently in the Syrian Civil War, where precision-guided munitions revolutionized air-to-ground combat."

Guidance: Mid-course guidance systems (such as inertial navigation, GPS, or radar) direct the missile toward its target. \n4. Terminal Phase: In the final phase, the missile uses radar, infrared, or laser homing to lock onto the target, ensuring a high hit probability. \n5. Impact: Upon reaching the target, the missile detonates, either through impact or proximity fuses, to inflict maximum damage."

Passive and resistant to jamming. Example: AIM-9 Sidewinder, MICA IR.\n\n• **Radar Seeker**:\n  - *Active Radar*: Has its own transmitter and receiver (e.g., AIM-120 AMRAAM).\n  - *Semi-Active Radar*: Relies on external radar from the launcher (e.g., Sparrow).\n  - *Passive Radar*: Detects enemy radar emissions without broadcasting.\n\n• **Laser Seeker**: Homes in on laser energy reflected from targets 'painted' by a laser designator. Example: AGM-114 Hellfire, Paveway bombs.\n\n• **Electro-Optical (EO) Seeker**: Uses visible or IR cameras for image-based tracking. Often enhanced with Imaging IR (IIR) for greater precision. Example: Spike missile, Javelin.\n\n• **Millimeter-Wave (MMW) Seeker**: Operates at 30–300 GHz for all-weather, day-night tracking. Often used in fire-and-forget systems. Example: Brimstone, Hellfire (fire-and-forget variants).\n\n• **Dual-Mode / Multi-Mode Seekers**: Combine two or more modes (e.g., radar + IR) for redundancy and improved resistance to countermeasures. Example: MBDA MMP (IR + EO), Spike ER2."

Modern missiles now use digital fly-by-wire systems and computer-controlled actuators to achieve high precision. The development of thrust vector control (TVC) and reaction control systems (RCS) further expanded control capabilities, particularly for maneuverability outside the atmosphere."
